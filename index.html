        Whos is Alma?
    </h2>
    <p>
        I am someone who finds joy in little things such as meer compliments and being appreciated.
        One of my favourite traits is my ability to lead in different aspects such as character-wise 
        and above all perfomance wise.What stands out is my ability to listen more than to speak.I 
        am a God fearing woman who seeks to acquire more spiritual growth as much as possible.A clear 
        definition of Alma is a young woman who is confident, willing to stand out from the rest
        kind,caring,loving,God fearing ,perseverant and always grateful for the little things she 
        achieves.
